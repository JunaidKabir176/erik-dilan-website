          <div id="issueSummary-sample_issue" class="issue-summary">
            <p>
        Assemblyman Erik Dilan has built his career around strengthening housing stability for New Yorkers, fighting displacement, and protecting tenants 
        from abuse. He supports legislation that criminalizes landlord harassment of rent-regulated tenants, reins in speculative real-estate flipping, 
        and expands safeguards for vulnerable renters, including individuals with disabilities and service animals. Erik approaches housing 
        as a foundational right, pushing policies that preserve affordability, curb predatory practices, and ensure families can remain 
        safely rooted in their communities.

          </h3>

            <p>
            As Chair of the Assembly Committee on Correction, Erik Dilan leads efforts to bring transparency, accountability, and dignity to New York’s 
            correctional system. He works to strengthen oversight of correctional facilities, improve conditions for incarcerated individuals, and 
            expand reentry resources so people can successfully transition back into society. Erik’s approach is grounded in public safety paired with 
            fairness — advancing reforms that reduce recidivism, support rehabilitation, and uphold the civil rights of all New Yorkers.

            <p>
        Erik Dilan champions policies that ease financial pressures on working families and protect consumers from unfair economic practices. 
        His legislative work includes pushing for transparency in credit-reporting, limiting abusive real-estate speculation, and safeguarding 
        residents from financial exploitation. Through his committee roles, he advocates for affordable utilities, fair insurance practices, and 
        economic policies that reduce burdens on low- and middle-income households. Erik prioritizes legislation that strengthens economic fairness and 
        promotes stability for everyday New Yorkers.

          </h3>
          <div id="issueSummary-decriminalizing-poverty" class="issue-summary">
            <p>
            Erik Dilan is a strong advocate for disability rights, especially within the housing system, sponsoring legislation that broadens reasonable 
            accommodation protections and shields individuals with disabilities from discrimination. His work ensures that tenants who rely on service or 
            support animals cannot be unfairly denied housing or harassed by landlords. Erik’s commitment reflects a belief that every New Yorker deserves 
            dignity, safety, and equitable treatment — and that policy must protect those most at risk of being overlooked.

            <p>
            Rooted in decades of public service in North Brooklyn, Erik Dilan consistently fights for investments that uplift working families and 
            strengthen neighborhood infrastructure. He champions funding for local schools, senior centers, community programs, and public-safety 
            partnerships while ensuring underserved areas receive their fair share of state resources. Erik’s leadership reflects a deep commitment 
            to equity and community empowerment — prioritizing policies that improve quality of life, expand opportunity, and ensure that government 
            works for the people it serves.
